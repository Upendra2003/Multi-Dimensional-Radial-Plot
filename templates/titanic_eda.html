              This is a 3D radar chart with axes labeled Radial X, Radial Y, and Radial Z, each scaled from -1 to 1. The attributes plotted are Titanic features: SibSp (strong positive on Radial Z, ~0.8), Age (moderate positive on Radial X, ~0.4), Pclass (strong positive on Radial Y, ~0.7), Sex_female (strong positive on Radial Y ~0.6, slight negative on Radial Z ~ -0.2), Fare (moderate positive on Radial X, ~0.5), and Parch (small positive on Radial Z, ~0.3).

              The fixed 3D viewing angle ensures equal visibility across attributes but introduces slight distortion due to the depth effect, making comparisons of magnitudes across axes challenging. The axes are plotted radially: Radial X (horizontal) highlights Age and Fare, Radial Y (diagonal bottom-left to top-right) emphasizes Pclass and Sex_female, and Radial Z (vertical) focuses on SibSp and Parch. Comparing attributes, Pclass and Sex_female show strong positive loadings on Radial Y, indicating a significant influence in that dimension, while SibSp dominates on Radial Z. Age and Fare have moderate contributions on Radial X, and Parch has a smaller influence on Radial Z. The overlap between Pclass and Sex_female on Radial Y suggests a correlation, while SibSp’s distinct position on Radial Z indicates a unique contribution.

              Pclass and Sex_female are key predictors of survival, as their strong positive loadings on Radial Y suggest they explain significant variance in the survival outcome. SibSp’s prominence on Radial Z indicates it also plays a critical role, possibly reflecting family dynamics impacting survival chances. Age and Fare contribute moderately, suggesting they are less dominant but still relevant factors. The viewing angle and axis plotting reveal that Sex_female and Pclass likely have the strongest influence on survival, aligning with historical Titanic insights where women and higher-class passengers had higher survival rates.

              This is a 3D biplot with axes Radial X (horizontal, -1 to 1), Radial Y (depth, -1 to 1), and Radial Z (vertical, -1 to 1). Green vectors represent Pclass, Sex_female, and Survived, while red vectors include Age, SibSp, Parch, and Fare. Green vectors point strongly positive on Radial X (~0.7 for Survived, ~0.6 for Sex_female, ~0.5 for Pclass), while red vectors point moderately positive on Radial Y (Fare ~0.5, Age ~0.4, SibSp and Parch ~0.3).

              The tilted viewing angle enhances the separation between green and red vectors, making their distinct contributions clear. Radial X is the primary axis of separation, with green vectors (Pclass, Sex_female, Survived) clustering together, indicating a strong positive correlation among them. Radial Y captures the red vectors, with Fare and Age showing moderate positive contributions, followed by SibSp and Parch. Radial Z shows minimal spread, suggesting less variance along this axis. Comparing attributes, Survived aligns closely with Sex_female and Pclass, while Age, SibSp, Parch, and Fare form a separate group, indicating different influences on survival. The axis plotting emphasizes Radial X as the key dimension for survival-related attributes.

              The strong alignment of Survived with Sex_female and Pclass on Radial X confirms that gender and passenger class are critical survival predictors, with females and higher-class passengers more likely to survive. The red vectors (Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) on Radial Y suggest these attributes influence survival differently, possibly indicating that younger passengers, those with family, or those who paid higher fares had varying survival chances. The viewing angle highlights these two distinct groups, providing insight into the Titanic’s survival dynamics.

The viewing angle is tilted to reduce line overlap, showing clear clustering: green lines cluster at high Sex_female (0.8–1.0) and low Pclass (0–0.3, meaning higher class), while red lines dominate at low Sex_female (0–0.2) and high Pclass (0.7–1.0, meaning lower class).

Fare shows some separation, with green lines often at higher values (0.6–1.0). Age, SibSp, and Parch exhibit more overlap, with less distinct clustering, though green lines slightly favor lower Age (0.2–0.5) and moderate SibSp and Parch (0.3–0.6).

              The plot confirms that Sex_female and Pclass are the most significant survival predictors, with females and higher-class passengers (low Pclass values) far more likely to survive, as shown by the green line clusters. Fare also plays a role, with higher fares linked to survival, possibly due to its correlation with Pclass. Age, SibSp, and Parch have less pronounced effects, but younger passengers and those with moderate family sizes may have slight survival advantages. The viewing angle and parallel axis plotting effectively reveal these hierarchical influences on Titanic survival.

Age, SibSp, and Parch have smaller differences, with green lines slightly favoring lower Age (0.2–0.5) and moderate SibSp and Parch (0.3–0.6). The radial axis plotting emphasizes Sex_female and Pclass as key differentiators.

              The spider plot confirms that Sex_female and Pclass are the primary survival predictors, with survivors (green lines) being predominantly female and from higher classes. Fare’s higher values among survivors further support the role of wealth in survival outcomes. Age, SibSp, and Parch play secondary roles, with slight trends toward younger passengers and moderate family sizes among survivors. The viewing angle and radial axis plotting provide a clear visual of how these attributes collectively shape survival patterns in the Titanic dataset.
